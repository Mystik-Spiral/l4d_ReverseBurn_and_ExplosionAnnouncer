### `ReverseBurn and ExplosionAnnouncer`
(l4d_ReverseBurn_and_ExplosionAnnouncer) by *_Mystik Spiral_*  

Smart reverse of burn damage from explodables (gascans, fireworks, etc.) if the victim is burned instantly and continuously.  
It was created to help mitigate the damage by griefers attempting to kill/incap their teammates by burning them.  

Reverses the following explodable burn types:  
Gas can, barricade gas can, fuel barrel, gas pump, and fireworks crate.  

Announces the following explosion types:  
Gas can, barricade gas can, fuel barrel, gas pump, fireworks crate, propane tank, and oxygen tank.  

Features:  
- Burn damage is reversed only if victim(s) are burned instantly (within 0.75 second of ignition) and continuously (takes burn damage more than once per second).  
- If player runs into fire more than 0.75 seconds after ignition, burn damage is treated normally.  
- When burn damage is reversed, during each burn cycle (approximately 6x per second):  
	* Attacker takes 70% damage for each instantly/continously burned victim.  
	* Standing burn victims lose 1PermHP which is converted to 2TempHP as incentive to move out of the fire quickly.  
	* Before ignition, any players already incapped or with only 1TotalHP do not take any burn damage.  
- Bots do not take burn damage but do move out of the fire as quickly as possible.  
- Griefers cannot kill or incap a victim by burning them (victims still take some damage as stated above).  
- In all other scenarios, burn damage behaves normally.  
- Option to reverse burn damage if attacker is an admin. [RBaEA_admin, default: 0/false]
- Option to reverse blast (explosion) damage (propane/oxygen tank, fuel barrel, gas pump). [RBaEA_blast, default: 1/true]

Common Scenarios:  
- Griefer attempts to kill the whole team by burning them.  
Usual end result: Griefer takes 210% damage (70% per victim x 3 victims) plus possible additional self-damage and everyone else takes relatively minor damage.  

- Player starts fire (which does not burn anyone within 0.75 seconds) and griefer runs into it.  
Usual end result: Griefer takes normal damage and player that started the fire takes no damage.  

Suggestion:  

Use this plugin in conjunction with:  

**[ReverseBurn and ThrowableAnnouncer](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=331166)** (l4d_ReverseBurn_and_ThrowableAnnouncer)  
...and...  
**[Reverse Friendly-Fire](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=329035)** (l4d_reverse_ff)  

When these plugins are combined, griefers cannot inflict friendly-fire, and it minimizes damage to victims for throwable (molotov) and explodable (gascans, fireworks, etc.) burn types.  
Although griefers will take significant damage, other players may not notice any difference in game play (other than laughing at stupid griefer fails).

This plugin began life as **[Explosion Announcer](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=328006)** by Marttt.  The original plugin kept track of explodable entities, when they were exploded, and announced who did it. I hooked on to that announcement to track whether that explodable (gascan, fireworks, etc.) instantly burned any other players, and if so, to ensure the attacker took the vast majority of the damage. If no other players are instantly burned, then burn damage is treated normally.
